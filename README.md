## 🔥 Overview

This project focuses on **dynamic image classification** and **object detection** for vehicles. The system is designed to classify vehicles into distinct categories: **2-Wheeler**, **3-Wheeler**, **LCV (Light Commercial Vehicle)**, **Car**, and **Bicycle**. By leveraging **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, a pretrained model, and **CVAT** for annotation, this solution can detect and classify vehicles in various environments and real-time scenarios.

**Key Features**:  
- **Real-time Classification:** Detects and classifies vehicles efficiently in images and video streams.  
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved using a state-of-the-art YOLO model.  
- **Vehicle Types:** Classifies vehicles into **2-Wheeler**, **3-Wheeler**, **LCV**, **Car**, and **Bicycle** categories.  
- **Annotation and Training:** Annotations done using **CVAT** and model training using **YOLO**.
